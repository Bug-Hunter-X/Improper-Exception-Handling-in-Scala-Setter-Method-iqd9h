# Scala Setter Method Exception Handling

This repository showcases a common yet subtle error in Scala: improper exception handling within a setter method. The original code throws an `IllegalArgumentException` for invalid input, but the handling could be more robust and informative.

The `BuggySetter.scala` file demonstrates the initial, flawed code, while `FixedSetter.scala` presents an improved version.

The key improvements in the fixed version include:

- **More informative exception messages:** Provides context to aid debugging.
- **Consideration of other error cases:** Although this specific example focuses on negative values, a production-ready solution would incorporate more comprehensive validation.
- **Alternative handling strategies:**  Instead of just throwing an exception, alternative approaches like defaulting to a safe value or logging the error could be implemented based on the specific application's requirements.
